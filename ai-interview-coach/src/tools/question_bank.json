        "answer": "OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in Java organizes code into objects using principles like Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction." },

      { "id": "j2", "q": "What is a Java class?", 
        "answer": "A Java class is a blueprint for creating objects, containing fields and methods." },

      { "id": "j3", "q": "What is JVM?", 
        "answer": "JVM (Java Virtual Machine) runs Java bytecode and provides platform independence." }

      { "id": "j4", "q": "Explain method overloading vs overriding.",
        "answer": "Overloading occurs within the same class with different parameter lists. Overriding happens in a subclass with same method signature." },

      { "id": "j5", "q": "What is the difference between abstract class and interface?",
        "answer": "Abstract classes can have implemented methods; interfaces cannot (until default methods). A class can extend one abstract class but implement multiple interfaces." },

        "answer": "Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free unused objects." }
